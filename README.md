# The *Un*flattening
A Minecraft mod that undoes all changes made by "The Flattening" in 1.13.

This includes making every block be a nunerical ID.

## Why?
Because it's obviously better. You can remember what blocks each number represents, and write commands faster with the old method. (/hj)

In all seriousness, mostly for fun 

## What are the supported versions?
We plan to support everything from 1.13 to the latest release.

We will use the `rift/1.13` and `fabric/1.14` trough `fabric/1.20.6` for the code for each version.
